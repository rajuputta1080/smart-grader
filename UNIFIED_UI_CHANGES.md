# Unified UI Changes - Smart Grader

## 🎯 What Changed

Simplified the UI to have **ONE unified interface** that automatically handles both:
- ✅ Single student evaluation (1 answer sheet)
- ✅ Multiple student evaluation (2-50 answer sheets)

---

## 🔄 Changes Made

### ✅ Removed:
- ❌ "Switch to Bulk Evaluation" toggle button
- ❌ Separate `BulkUploadForm` component (no longer used)
- ❌ All mentions of "Bulk" in the UI

### ✅ Updated:
1. **UploadForm.js** - Now intelligently handles both single and multiple answer sheets
2. **App.js** - Simplified to only show one upload form
3. **File Upload Logic** - Fixed bug where adding files would replace instead of add

---

## 📋 How It Works Now

### User Experience:

1. **Same UI as before** - No confusion, no mode switching
2. **Upload question paper** (1 file)
3. **Upload answer sheet(s):**
   - Upload 1 file → Single evaluation (old behavior)
   - Upload 2+ files → Automatic bulk evaluation (new feature)
4. **Button text adapts:**
   - "Start Evaluation" (1 student)
   - "Start Evaluation (5 students)" (multiple students)

### Behind the Scenes:

```javascript
// Automatically detects and routes appropriately
if (answerSheet.length === 1) {
  → Single Evaluation API (/api/evaluate)
  → Shows processing page → Results page
}

if (answerSheet.length > 1) {
  → Bulk Evaluation API (/api/evaluate-bulk)
  → Shows progress tracker with live updates
}
```

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### **Issue:** Adding multiple files replaced existing ones

**Before:**
```javascript
// When selecting files, it would replace all existing files
setAnswerSheet(Array.from(e.target.files));
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Now it adds new files to existing array
const newFiles = Array.from(e.target.files);
setAnswerSheet(prev => [...prev, ...newFiles]);
```

**Result:** You can now:
1. Select 2 files
2. Click again and select 3 more files
3. Total: 5 files ready for evaluation ✅

## 🎨 UI Enhancements

### 1. **Dynamic Header**
```
When 1 file:  "Answer Sheet (1 file)"
When 5 files: "Answer Sheets (5 files)"
```

### 2. **Multi-Student Badge**
Shows purple badge when evaluating multiple students:
```
📚 Evaluating 5 students simultaneously
```

### 3. **Scrollable File List**
When you upload many files (10+), the list becomes scrollable (max 300px height)

### 4. **Smart Button Text**
```
1 student:  "Start Evaluation"
5 students: "Start Evaluation (5 students)"
Processing: "Starting Evaluation..."
```
